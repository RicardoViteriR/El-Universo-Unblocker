# El-Universo-Unblocker

Script to unblock blurring at www.eluniverso.com

The script is unptimized, but good enough.

## How to use

Go to the page where content is blurred, go to dev tools, copy and paste the code from index.js in the console

## Install as a Chrome Extension so you don't have to copy and paste the code

1. Go to Chrome Extensions
2. Enabel developer developer mode (top right corner)
3. Click on "Load unpacked" button
4. Load the folder with manifest.json file (may look like an empty folder)
